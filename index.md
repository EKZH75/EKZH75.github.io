## Welcome to the home page of Emmanuel Kravitzch

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/EKZH75/EKZH75.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

I am a PhD student of Computer sciences between two labs: LIA Avignon (France) and L2S Centrale-Supélec (France). 
[Yezekael Hayel](https://sites.google.com/site/yezekaelhayelsite/) (LIA), [Vineeth S. Varma](https://sites.google.com/site/vineethshome/) (CRAN) and Antoine O. Berthet have the heavy duty to supervise me. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EKZH75/EKZH75.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
